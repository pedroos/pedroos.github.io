<p>Today, I learned one lesson the hard way and wanted to share to that other people and business owners don't fall for the same trap.</p>

<p>When you've worked as a single-person entity for a significant part of your professional life, either as an employee or a one-person business, and you've signed a contract, you may not have given complete consideration to your work contract, be it an employee or client contract.</p>

<p>Of course, employee contracts should be more consistent, but when you sign a client contract, <b>you should understand it completely and eliminate any doubts, before signing it</b>.</p>

<p>This is irrespective of the way your contact was found by the client, the communication style of the client, the perceived environment in the client, or any other factors related to the process through which you arrived at the opportunity to sign up, or even after your partnership started.</p>

<p>This also extends to a situation in which you may have <i>already signed up</i> and started on your role: you should disconsider completely any factors and understand your contract, first, and then eliminate all points of unclarity.</p>

<p>This implies going through all legislations involved, researching them, and consulting specialists in the field, if needed, and discussing them with your partner until you're completely certain of all responsibilities and roles that you're going to be performing. You should go into day one completely sure of your position in each of these roles and never deviate "too much" from your roles: your contract should be the center of your daily mode of operation towards that client, as there's a reason why that, as written in your contract, was signed by you.</p>

<p>Of course, in an integrative and collaborative environment, you should <i>personally</i> behave like what's required to best perform your role and integrate into the larger team in your client's organization. But you should never lose sight of the roles that are set out in your contract, from a business standpoint.</p>

<p>If you let that slip, by the time your discover you've been misaligned, you may have to take corrective measures which will impact on you and your client. And this could range from very small impact to large impact as well, depending on your roles. And that, of course, will impact you severely.</p>

<p>What I'd recommend is that as a company, no matter the size (and no matter also the size of your client), you have the same utmost attention and rigor to all your contracts. If necessary, engage trusted specialists in your pre-signing procedures and work with your potential client to make sure you're on the right foot and "ready to deliver" going in.</p>

<p>Sometimes, mistakes happen. But preventing this mistake will be worthwhile for your entire career and foster the necessary productive relationships that should be taking place instead of dealing with corrective measures late in your relationship with your client.</p>

    <!-- <p>In this blog, I try to do some critical evaluation so you can use its final product in a ready state. I'd try to analogize it to software libraries: but, instead of code, we'd be writing logical assertions.</p>

    <p>These logical assertions form systems which are like programs of the mind. If a logical program is sound, it can be reused and provide certain guarantees about the objects which it talks about, much like you can run a well-formed computer program.</p>

    <p>This is what mathematicians have been doing for millenia<sup>1</sup>, since Euclid, but yet Mathematics has a fame for being about numbers. I think numbers are just one object treated by Mathematics.</p>
    
    <p>Programming is like creating theories, too. But the logic of programming languages is much more sophisticated than the logic of assertions used here. But they're also dealing with more complex systems of objects than, say, the objects dealt with in human language.</p>

    <p>In fact, this last statement may be wrong, and this is an opportunity to make more robust the ways in which we deal with human language.</p>

    <p>But back to subject, in this way, I want to combat the view that <i>theory is pointless</i>, or that abstraction is all bad. It, in fact, depends on which are the objects about which we're talking.</p>

    <p>If what the logical system says also makes sense on the linguistic level, taking into account the contents of subjects, adjectives and other syntactical objects present in the theory, then we're lucky and can claim to hold a solid foundation for discussing those themes.</p>

    <p>If not, <i>then</i> we may be accused of going on precise chains of thoughts about useless things. (This, used artistically, is Dadaism &mdash; one of my favorite artistic expressions.) But that's another subject.</p>

    <p>Here, we want to make logical assertions about things like data structures, algorithms, and even some mathematical objects, invariably computational objects. Not complex but simple objects. In a way, we're dealing with some of the material that has been already formalized in theoretical computer science textbooks; but we may dispute what or the way it was formalized, much like each library in programming has a distinct focus and targets. Our targets are simplicity, reuse, and minimalism. Our objective is not to fill a hundreds-page book (neither could we) because we're not interested in exhaustive treatments, we're interested in the "core library" (or libraries).</p>

    <p>We're also interested in building tools, demonstrations, practical uses, diagrams, and whatever else it takes to transmit it wholly. We want to take these things out of "book format" and into rich media, in a way.</p>

    <p>This kind of thing is really simple and it permeates our lives. It's downright tragic that these are things only computer science theorists, or logical philosophists ever get to examine.</p>

    <p><sup>1</sup> Mathematics is not fully sound; but I advocate for reducing the size of our subject matters (which Mathematics doesn't try to do), so that we maximize their completeness. I'm also for deeply comprehending the nature of incompleteness and developing tools, languages and facilities for minimizing it. That's what Software Engineering does for programming, but I want to extend this to languages other than programming languages.</p>

    <hr/>

    <p>By the way, did you know? The first published truth table was written by a woman, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christine_Ladd-Franklin" target="_blanK">Christine Ladd</a>, in 1881, 40 years before philosopher Wittgenstein introduced it. (See <a href="https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2020/12/where-did-combinators-come-from-hunting-the-story-of-moses-schonfinkel/" target="_blank">here</a>). She was actually refused higher studies for her gender, and later was accepted with restrictions. You can see the printed truth table <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=A48XAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA62" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

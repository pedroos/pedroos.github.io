<p>Hi! My name is Pedro. I'm a programmer currently living in Brazil.</p>

<p>I opened this blog in 2016 and started writing things about software engineering in it. I have always been a compiled language developer but my main progress at the time I opened it was of working with shells and their automation capabilities.</p>

<!-- <p>In 2017, I decided to try enrolling in a full Mathematics course (BsC), and 1 and a half years into it, it had messed my entire intellectual life and put it upside-down. I felt difficulty accepting the way Mathematics seemed to be structured and presented. I started programming what I was trying to learn and deriving conclusions which I then posted. Basically, the conclusions were that there were some significant lessons the Mathematical language could take from programming languages. I basically started rewriting what I knew of it within a modern programming vocabulary.</p>

<p>I didn't go on to finish the course; the sheer applied nature of number systems didn't entice me (I still think integers, apart from primes, are overspecification &mdash; we want to know the boundaries, not the actual numbers). I got hooked on Logic, Proofs, and from there, Mathematical Logic and Computability. Finally, I arrived at Computer Science again, like I was discovering it, coming from Linguistics (Chomsky). I got a hold of Logical Systems, the problem of Undecidability, and all the things we do, in programming, to avoid it. This has given me incidental insight into what to look for in programming languages. For example, I invest more time into Functional Programming. (Of course, this heads us to Abstract Algebra which takes us back to Mathematics &mdash; let's not get dizzy.)</p>

<p>From my own experiences, I observed the recursive nature of programming: it not only has levels of abstraction, but it does recurse where the most dynamic thing becomes the most static thing again. Then, I learned this is a more general phenomenon (Self-Reference), which seems to transcend programming. Then, AI came along, and this might even seem relevant to that as well. This helped me be more flexible and detached about my programming choices, as I saw programming is basically the same and we only change the level at which we implement it.</p> -->

<p>Along the way, I've programmed a number of ideas on my own. I plan to release those progressively. I have since then started crystallizing some of those concepts into increasingly formal writeups and simple implementations. <!--This helps to keep things pure and crystal-clear. (Note: I'm not interested in changing the world or discovering any new things &mdash; but merely in framing bodies of knowledge in my way, like mentioned above.) I've been growing weary of informal treatments of stuff. I hoped this would be restrained to my writing on this blog but I've observed it develop into a more general attitude towards the world, where a number of things could be improved.--></p>

<p>Here, you'll find the results of my work, of which I hope there is a mix of concept and utility. <!--I don't appreciate speculative theories and like to keep things computational - code with unit tests is great for that.--></p>

<p>Professionally, I am always looking for opportunities &mdash; areas of expertise include significant compiled code software engineering and data engineering projects in the cloud.</p>

<p>Due to the speed at which technology moves, it could argued that, at times, it is too fast. But this point has several problems.</p>

<p>First, it is in the nature of technology and science to discover. I'd much prefer to go too fast than to artificially slow down.</p>

<p>This creates a split between possible attitudes towards the speed of technology: you either embrace it, or you give up and make your own pace.</p>

<p>I for a long time, and I think a lot of people, have embraced it. I think once you do embrace it psychologically, you are well-armed to succeed in following it, because your successes and milestones are now incremental. It's an inertia-based strategy.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you detach from it, each time you'll want to sync back, you will have some significant work to do. Such experience will not be a continuous one but a jagged, discontinuous one with some amount of loss of context, which could be crucial.</p>

<p>Now, I want to introduce the notion that it is possible that <i>some</i> of the high speed of technical innovation is leveraged and used as a market strategy. If, say, a country has superiority over supply of a certain good, it can, to various degrees, use this to convince other countries which want to have that good, to, instead of seeking to make it themselves, to buy it from them. For example, a country which produces a lot of gold, and sell gold bars to countries which make jewelry to a population eager to consume it. But this needn't be a country; it can be merely an all-powerful company.</p>

<p>It is a rational and simple decision to how much this commercial relationship makes sense; basically drawing a curve of benefit vs. cost of acquisition, factoring in any accrued gains, based on how desireable the good is, and getting a precise, numerical answer out of it. The more the buyer may want to keep consuming the good for longer period of time, presumably, the more it starts to make sense for they to think about fabricating it (when factible). The more it's a matter of fashion, or a time-based or atypical need, then the more it is justifiable to be just bought in ready form.</p>

<p>Now, technology is so large a field (in fact, from my view, it can be related to human progress itself, so not all technology is really industry-driven) that it has both components in large quantities in its industrial dynamics. There is huge demand everywhere for both the science of it and the more utilitary or practical side of it. So it can be reasonably planned how to integrate technology into a buyers's plan, creating a balanced mix of all needs and fostering productive supplier-customer relationships and growth.</p>

<p>However, when everything changes every four years, plans are thrown out of the window on a whim, people are out of their depth talking about random things in an unclear way almost close to noise, it's impossible to draw a realistic plan. Things are then resolved on the will of a few people, depending on fragile assumptions. That opens up the door for bad actors who are interested in using that confusion as a business model. They could oversell a <i>need</i> which is about their profit, it's not about the intellectual improvement of the customer. This creates a relationship of dependency instead of fostering a growth relationship. This is so serious and can be damaging because a market can be precluded from advancing its own park.</p>

<p>I'm not a nationalist; I'm not concerned with what my country does officially and for formal reasons, and what is written on a banner. I'm concerned with people's minds, thoughts and attitudes towards changes. If some people are passive, they want to sit around the corners. This may not be their fault, it's just how incentives work: if you have no real incentive, you have to keep motivating yourself, and that's hard work. A much better scenario is for incentive to be present so that people are pushed and move things forward.</p>

<p>Now, it's not about assigning blame either. A consumer can self-diagnose and say 'no' when appropriate. Then, it can trace a path towards sustenance that is better than being a dependent of a supplier of something important. The demand controls the supply; not the other way around.</p>

<p>And, if more grave things are installed, such as internal sabotages, excuse interests, then those things must be dealt with with robustness. By why believe such cases?</p>

<h2>Remarks</h2>

<p>Actors should be able to choose innovation. Despite the importance of innovation, it's not on the same group of needs as proper living conditions, sanitation, or freedom of speech. It can improve and accelerate those issues significantly (and that's one exciting aspects of innovation), but those things can be dealth with ultimately with old, tried-and-proven methods; innovation is <i>not</i> a requirement on the basic levels of the Hierarchy of Needs.</p>

<p>Innovation is a gift. It is an act of sharing. It's the core of any vibrant and beneficial commercial activity and should be taken care of.</p>
